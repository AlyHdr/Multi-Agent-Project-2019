## 1. Introduction

The aim of the project was to design and program a multi-agent based virtual community management platform for sharing information within a smart city. The city is equipped with **community servers** situated in places or buildings of the city.
Inhabitants of such smart cities are provided with a smart device that contains a **community assistant** that acts under his/her control. They delegate to this community assistant the management of the sharing of information according to the topics that he/she is interested in and to the information he/she is ready to share with other users.
The implementation of this concept was done using the **JaCaMo** platform which is used for multi-agent based programming and we used **github** as versioning tool to work collaboratively.

## 2. System Specifications
In this section, a low level description of our system is demonstrated where each member worked on implementing one type of assistants (i.e **Agent**) and one type of community (i.e **Artifact**).And over those there was an abstract layer as user controll which used a (user_agent,UserArtifact).
